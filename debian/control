Description: SCAP content for CIS and DISA-STIG Ubuntu Benchmarks
 This package contains SCAP content to support the automation of
 compliance evaluation for CIS v1.0.0 and DISA-STIG V1R11 Benchmarks.
 This includes XCCDF, OVAL, CPE and tailoring files.
 .
 SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a set of standards to
 enable automated vulnerability amanagement, measurement, and policy
 compliance evaluation of systems deployed in an organization.
 The SCAP content in this package is expected to be passed into SCAP
 auditing tools that utilize the Extensible Configuration Checklist
 Description Format (XCCDF). It was tested with openSCAP which has been
 extended to include bash scripts as part of the content.
